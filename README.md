********************************************************

Version 5.10 of the RGA Applications software marked a 
major change in the way in which the control units 
communicate with the PC software.  For most users many of 
these changes will all be 'below the surface', since they 
do not affect the user experience or the way in which 
users interact with EasyView or Process Eye Professional.  
However, the changes do open new possibilities for control 
of the RGA's using alternative OEM software, for example.

If your existing software is prior to v5.10, you will have 
to download new firmware into each unit in turn before 
you can use your control units with the software on this 
CD-Rom.  The installer and set-up Assistants will guide you 
through the steps involved.  You should allow additional 
time to perform these upgrades.  It will be obvious that 
you will need access to all your instruments at the time 
that you install this software.

Version 5.10 ships with
	Core v5.00 for LM70, 75, 76, 92 and 101
	App v5.00 for LM70, 75, 76, 92 and 101
	Package v5 for LM92 and 101
	Package v1.23 for LM98 and 102

The core and app software is back-compatible with previous 
versions of the RGA software - i.e. control units with v5 
embedded software can continue to be used with earlier 
versions of the Process Eye / EasyView applications.  
However, if you have instruments that require packages 
(LM92, 98, 101 or 102), they will not function correctly 
with earlier application versions.

If you are not ready to undertake all the steps involved 
in upgrading, you are advised to cancel from the set-up 
CD-Rom and return at a later time.

Complete context-sensitive help is provided to cover all 
aspects of hardware and software installation.  You can 
access this help simply by pressing the F1 function key.

Whatever control units you have, version 5.10 integrates 
the way in which hardware is managed through a new RGA 
Device Manager.  You will want to spend some time 
familiarising yourself with this new application.

In comparison with earlier versions, this version offers 
new options in the deployment of the application software, 
where recipes and data are stored and how multiple users 
of a computer interact with each other.  However, for all 
upgraders, the Installation Assistant will assume by default 
that you will wish to continue using your software in the 
same way that you have used it until now.
